# ddnsclient
A simple DDNS client which currently only supports Mythic Beasts API.

# Usage

The client is intended to be simple and easy to use.

The main reason it was created was for giving users the ability to use DDNS. For this, run:
`ddnsclient ddns --username="your user" --password="your pass" your.domain.com`

Note that in the future, a config file will be used instead to take the API credentials.
